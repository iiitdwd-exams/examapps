# `examapps`

`examapps` is intended to be a collection of streamlet apps bound by a navigation page. Each app is meant to implement a simple but independent solution specific to the tasks of the Exam Cell at IIIT Dharwad. At present, there are two apps:

1. **Supplementray Exams Stats** prepares stats of students eligible to appear for Supplementary Exams and prepares a set of protected Microsoft Excel files which serve as registration forms for students.
2. **Remove PDF password** decrypts a password protected file using the known password and saves a decrypted form of the file.

In time, more apps are expected to be added.
